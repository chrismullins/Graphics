Programming Assignment 2: Christopher Mullins

Step 1: Edit the Makefile to point to your installation of Eigen and GLUT include files.  They might be correct as is, on a linux environment, but maybe not.

Step 2: Place all source files and the Makefile in the same directory, cd into that directory.  Now type make.

Step 3: All 4 executables should now be built in the same directory.  Enjoy!
